# connector-dummy
Dummy / template connector

# How to use
Clone this folder in the API root under the folder "connectors", like so:

```
\var\projects\pistation-api\connectors\connector-dummy
```

The connector folder is in gitignore in the API project, thus editing from here should work just fine.
